# Book: Assembly Language and Programming (Code Samples)

Selected code samples from book: "Assembly Language and Programming" by Peter Abel.

This old book did not provided an online version with the source code for the examples.  
I include here the transcription of some of the source code that I consider most relevant.

Code samples:
- P04ASM2.asm: MOV & AND instructions
- P09CTRNM.asm: center the given name on the screen
- P10BIOAS.asm: display ASCII characters
- P10GRAFX.asm: fill the screen with horizontal colored lines
- P10NMSCR.asm: inverse video, blink and screen scroll
- P15ASCHX.asm: display ASCII characters and their hexadecimal value
- P18RDSCT.asm: read disk sector (DOS interrupts)
- P19BIORD.asm: read disk sector (BIOS interrupts)
- P21MOUSE.asm: mouse handling, reporting mouse position
- P21SOUND.asm: plays sounds using the speaker

All this samples targets DOS (16-bit) and where compiled+tested with the ![MASM32 SDK](https://www.masm32.com/) on a virtual machine running WIN XP.
